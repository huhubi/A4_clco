## Requirements for testing

  ```bash
    $ pip install pytest
  ```

## Running the App

1. Create a new stack:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi stack init testing
    ```

1. Login to Azure CLI (you will be prompted to do this during deployment if you forget this step):

    ```bash
    $ az login
    ```

1. Create a Python virtualenv, activate it, and install dependencies:

    This installs the dependent packages [needed](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/how-pulumi-works/) for our Pulumi program.

    ```bash
    $ python3 -m venv venv
    $ .\.venv\Scripts\Activate  (Windows only)
    $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

1. Specify the Azure location to use:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi config set azure-native:location uksouth
    ```

1. Define SQL Server password (make it complex enough to satisfy Azure policy):

    ```bash
    $ pulumi config set --secret sqlPassword GanzGeheim123!
    ```

1. Run `pulumi up` to preview and deploy changes:

    ``` bash
    $ pulumi up
    Previewing changes:
    ...

    Performing changes:
    ...
    info: 10 changes performed:
        + 10 resources created
    Update duration: 1m14.59910109s
    ```

1. Check the deployed website endpoint:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi stack output endpoint
    https://azpulumi-as0ef47193.azurewebsites.net
    $ curl "$(pulumi stack output endpoint)"
    <html>
        <body>
            <h1>Greetings from Azure App Service!</h1>
        </body>
    </html>
    ```
1. Get the endpoint:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi stack output endpoint
    https://azpulumi-as0ef47193.azurewebsites.net
    $ curl "$(pulumi stack output endpoint)"
    <html>
        <body>
            <h1>Greetings from Azure App Service!</h1>
        </body>
    </html>
    ```
   
1. If pulumi is messed up:
   ```bash
    $ pulumi cancel
    ```

## Found issues

### Refactored Deployment Approach

#### Original Implementation
The original file used `asset.AssetArchive` to package and deploy the application as a ZIP file:

```python
source=asset.AssetArchive({"app.py": asset.FileAsset("app.py")})
```

#### Adapted Implementation
The adapted file directly uses `asset.FileAsset` to upload `app.py` without zipping:

```python
source=asset.FileAsset("app.py")
```

This also turned out not to work, as the `app.py` file was not found in the deployment package.

So I changed the approach and used the deployment via direct index.html and without flask.
